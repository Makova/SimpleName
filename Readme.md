SimpleNAme
==========

SimpleNAme is a `gnome-shell` extension (for the new gnome shell, versions > 3),
that shows the name of the current user on the upper right hand corner of the
screen, remembering the old setups of previous window managers.

It is just a little graphical enhancement, for all who want to recall
previous versions.
